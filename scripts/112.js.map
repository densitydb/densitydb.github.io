A crucial\n                                    issue with this metric is that can never be 0, even in a perfectly integrated\n                                    society. To address this, Massey and Denton normalize their metric, creating the\n                                    V or Eta squared index, by subtracting out the minimum possible value of the\n                                    isolation index, then dividing by 1 minus the minimum possible value.\n\n                                    We do the same, creating the metric\n                                    <MathJax style={{ height: '80px', overflow: 'hidden' }}>\n                                        {\n                                            `\\\\[S(B) = \\\\frac{H(B) - H_{\\\\text{min}}(B)}{1 - H_{\\\\text{min}}(B)}\\\\]`\n                                        }\n                                    </MathJax>\n                                    where we can compute\n                                    <MathJax style={{ height: '53px', overflow: 'hidden' }}>\n                                        {\n                                            `\\\\[H_{\\\\text{min}}(B) = \\\\mathbb E_{b \\\\in B} [v_b^T] \\\\mathbb E_{b \\\\in B} [w_b]\\\\]`\n                                        }\n                                    </MathJax>\n                                    as the minimum possible value of the homogenity metric (the one that would be achieved\n                                    if every block had the same racial distribution).\n                                </p>\n                                <p>\n                                    A final issue with the segregation metric as described above is that it is not\n                                    local. That is, it cannot be expressed as the average of a value computed for each\n                                    block.\n                                </p>\n                                <p>\n                                    To see why this might be problematic, imagine a state that has exactly two\n                                    cities, 100 miles apart, each of which is perfectly integrated, but one is\n                                    75% white and 25% black, and the other is 75% black and 25% white.\n                                </p>\n                                <p>\n                                    Each individual city would have a homogenity of 62.5%, but a segregation of 0%,\n                                    since the minimum homogenity is 62.5%. in each city.\n                                </p>\n                                <p>\n                                    The state as a whole would have the same homogenity, as expected, because\n                                    the homogenity metric is in fact local. However, the minimum homogenity for the\n                                    state would be 50%, since the state as a whole is 50% white and 50% black.\n                                    This means that the segregation metric would be 25% for the state.\n                                </p>\n                                <p>\n                                    In some sense this is a desirable property because one could argue that\n                                    the state is segregated, even though the cities are not, as people could\n                                    move between the cities and have not. As such, we do include this metric.\n                                    However, we also want to include a local segregation metric, to reflect\n                                    more local patterns of segregation and not penalize states that have, e.g.,\n                                    Native American reservations.\n                                </p>\n                                <p>\n                                    As such, we define a local region block segregation as the segregation metric\n                                    in a large region around a block (circle of radius 10km).\n                                    <MathJax style={{ height: '53px', overflow: 'hidden' }}>\n                                        {\n                                            `\\\\[S^{\\\\{10\\\\}}_{b}(B) = S(n_{10}(b))\\\\]`\n                                        }\n                                    </MathJax>\n                                    We then compute the average of this metric for each block.\n                                    <MathJax style={{ height: '53px', overflow: 'hidden' }}>\n                                        {\n                                            `\\\\[S^{\\\\{10\\\\}}(B) = \\\\mathbb E_{b \\\\in B} [S^{\\\\{10\\\\}}_{b}(B)]\\\\]`\n                                        }\n                                    </MathJax>\n                                </p>\n                            </div>\n                        </div>\n\n                        <h1>American Community Survey Data</h1>\n                        <div>\n                            All data listed in this section is collected from the 2021 American Community Survey 5-year estimates.\n\n                            <NRef name=\"citizenship\">Citizenship</NRef>\n                            <div>\n                                <p>\n                                    We analyze citizenship data by dividing the population into Citizen by Birth, Citizen by Naturalization,\n                                    and Not a Citizen.
